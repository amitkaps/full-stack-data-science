# Full Stack Data Science

> "Jack of all trades, master of none, though oft times better than master of one." 

One of the common pain points that we have come across in big organizations is the last-mile delivery of data science applications. One common delivery vehicle is to create dashboards(BI). But the one, that's very useful and neglected more often than not, is to create APIs and provide seamless integration with other applications within the company. This requires you to have a basic understanding of machine learning, server-side programming and front-end application.

In this workshop, you would learn how to build a seamless end-to-end data driven application - Data Exploration, Machine Learning Model, RESTful API and Web Application - to solve a business prediction problem.

## Course Content
1. Introduction to Data Exploration
2. Introduction to Machine Learning
3. Overview of the case we will be solving in the workshop
4. A simple ML model (linear/logistic regression)
5. Creating RESTful API
6. Integrating model output to DB
7. Updating the model as more data comes in (batch only - no streaming)
9. A simple webpage front-end to visualise the results and interact with the API.
8. Creating a simple application that accomplishes this end-to-end


## Target Audience
- **A programmer but not a data science practioner**: A programmer with experience in server-side or front-end development and maybe has some familiarity with doing data analysis. You could be looking to transition in to building data driven products or a create a richer product experience with data.
- **A data science practioner but not a programmer**: A data science with some experience in doing data analysis, preferably in a scripting language (R/Python/Scala), but wants to get a deeper and a more applied perspective on creating data driven products. 


##  Pre-requisites
- Programming knowledge is mandatory. Attendee should, at the bare minimum, be able to write conditional statements, use loops, be comfortable writing functions and be able to understand code snippets and come up with programming logic.
- Participants should have a basic familiarity of Python. Specifically, we expect participants to know the first three sections from this: http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/

## Software Requirements
We will be using Python data stack for the workshop. Please install Ananconda for Python 3.5 for the workshop. Additional requirement will be communicated to participants.
